#Toggle
======
Feature Toggle is common concept in the current software development process, especially if you want to do continous dilivery. But there is a pain for developer to test both Feature Toggle On and Off logic. Because most of Feature Toggle is just a Enum, It's static, It's hard to change the status of one Feature Toggle dynamicly. That's why i write this project.
**Toggle is a little java tool, which can help you easily test both  Feature Toggle on and off logic in one test class.** 

##How-TO
I'm trying to push this project into Maven central repository, Now it's waiting aprroval from Sonatype. when it's done, we can easily using maven depency include this little tool.

###step1: Include This Tool Into Your Project
There are three ways to include this tool into your project.
* 1. Using Maven depency(coming soon)
* 2. Download the project directly ([Download](https://github.com/xianlinbox/Toggle/archive/master.zip)) and add build/libs/Toggle.jar into your project classpath
* 3. Clone the source codes and add them into your project.

###step1ï¼šDefine Your Own Toggle Class
Your feature toggle class must implements interface Toggle and must using ToggleStatus enum as the switch of Feature Toggle.
```java
public enum MyFeatureToggle implements Toggle {
	TEST_FEATURE(ToggleStatus.ON), STAGE1(ToggleStatus.ON), STAGE2(ToggleStatus.OFF);
	private ToggleStatus status;

	MyFeatureToggle(ToggleStatus status) {
		this.status = status;
	}

	@Override
	public void setStatus(ToggleStatus status) {
		this.status = status;
	}

	public boolean isEnabled() {
		return status.equals(ToggleStatus.ON);
	}

	@Override
	public ToggleStatus getStatus() {
		return status;
	}

}
```

###step2: Apply Feature Toggle Test Rule To Your Test Class
Make sure the ToggleRule property is public.
```java
    @Rule
    public ToggleRule anotherToggleRule = new ToggleRule();
```

###step3: Add Annotation On the Test Method To Decide The Toggle Status When Run This Test
Now, this annotation support single, multiple and mixed Toggles.
```java
    @Test
    @ToggleEnabled(toggleClass = "example.MyFeatureToggle",toggleNames = "TEST_FEATURE")
    public void testEchoToggleOn() throws Exception {
	assertThat(server.echo("xianlinbox"), is("Toggle is on, xianlinbox"));
	}


    @Test	
    @ToggleEnabled(toggleClass = "example.MyFeatureToggle",toggleNames = {"STAGE1","STAGE2"})
    public void testMultipleToggle() throws Exception {
	assertThat(server.multipleToggleEcho("xianlinbox"), is("TestFeature is on, Stage 1 is on, Stage 2 is on, xianlinbox"));
	}

    @Test
    @ToggleDisabled(toggleClass = "example.MyFeatureToggle",toggleNames = {"STAGE1","TEST_FEATURE"})
    @ToggleEnabled(toggleClass = "example.MyFeatureToggle",toggleNames = "STAGE2")
    public void testMixedToggle() throws Exception {
	assertThat(server.multipleToggleEcho("xianlinbox"), is("Stage 2 is on, xianlinbox"));
	}

    @Test
    @ToggleDisabled(toggleClass = "example.MyFeatureToggle", toggleNames = {"STAGE1", "TEST_FEATURE"})
    @ToggleEnabled(toggleClass = "example.MyFeatureToggle2", toggleNames = "TEST_FEATURE_2")
    public void testMixedMultipleToggle() throws Exception {
	assertThat(server.multipleToggleEcho("xianlinbox"), is("TestFeature 2 is on, xianlinbox"));
	}
```

That's all , Hope you enjoy it.
